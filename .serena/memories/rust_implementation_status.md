# Rust Implementation Status

## Current State (Phase 4 Complete)
All core functionality has been implemented:

### Phase 1 ✅ - Core Infrastructure
- Packet format base classes and bit manipulation utilities
- Checksum calculation and validation (12-bit)
- All packet types (location, query, report, error)
- Extended field support with JSON specifications

### Phase 2 ✅ - Network & Clients
